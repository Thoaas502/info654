            <div class="gist">
                <p>Frank is a one year old Siberan Forest Cat and half brother to Bean. He is an orange boy, with a pink nose and pink paws.
                    <br />What can be said about Frank? 
                    <br />He is simple. He is here to give love and receive love. And also eat. 
                    <br />As you can see below, his tastes are broad, he is in no way picky and there are many more items that could be added to that list.
                    <br />Frank has an insatiable appetite. He hungers constantly. Which is why he's on a diet.

            <div id="more3">
                <p>There's a stereotype that orange cats don't have much going on upstairs and that rings true with Frank. When he is not eating, he is usually causing chaos. From scratching the walls and chewing furniture,
                    to getting as close as possible to Zoe before she hisses at him, and deciding after midnight is the best time to get in his steps, Frank is up to no good.
                    <br />However, he is still a baby, and babies get a pass. 
                    <br />Be aware that Frank does not like to be held, which is surprising because he loves to be pet. Frank will roll over onto his back the moment anyone touches him to get belly rubs.
                    But he will not stand for being picked up. He will wiggle and wiggle until he is free.
