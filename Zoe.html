            <div class="gist">
                <p>A fourteen year old Maine Coon, Zoe is the child of award-winning show cats. Which means she's very pretty and she knows it.
                    <br />Maine Coons are characterized by an 'M' marking on their foreheads and how they are generally larger than other cat breeds.

                    <br />Zoe is long-haired, with a mixture of grey, white, black, and brown fur. The pads of her paws are black, while her nose is reddish-brown.

                <p>Zoe is our little old lady. Although you certainly wouldn't know it by interacting with her. She is mostly likely aware that she is a cat, and she's not happy about it.
                    The only person she loves is my father, she tolerates the rest of us, except for her brothers. She really hates their existence. <i>Siblings, am I right?</i>
                    <br />Zoe is incredibly talkative and intelligent, responding to questions and remembering time schedules. It's also possible she suffers from feline OCD, she is constantly grooming herself and will not tolerate any fur out of place.
                    We truly believe her life would be better if she could relax. But she does get a nice range of food because she is very picky and will throw up if she eats too fast or fifteen minutes from her normal time.
