            <div class="gist">
                <p>Bean is a two year old <a href=https://cats.com/cat-breeds/siberian-cat>Siberan Forest</a> Cat who, like the Maine Coon, is also very fluffy. His fur is mostly brown and black, he has a red nose, black paw pads, and very long whiskers.
                    Like surprisingly long whiskers. A cat's whiskers are meant to be slightly longer than the widest parts of their body, and his are much longer than they need to be.
                    <br />He's still incredibly cute though.

                <h2>What he enjoys:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Squeaking</li>
                    <li>Wrestling</li>
                    <li>Naps</li>
                    <li>Climbing trees</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="more2">
                <p>Despite being two, his meow is still comparable to that of a newborn kitten. His younger brother, Frank, has a more pronouced meow than he does.
                    Don't let the squeaks or small size fool you though. Bean is still pretty sharp. He hides it by being calm and not disturbing others, the stereotypical 'middle sibling'. 
                    He's chill with life and you can pet or hold him anyway you like, he won't mind.
