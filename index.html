                    Since I was a young child, I've always loved animals. Anything that I could pet, I would. It did not matter if it was furry or scaly. 
                    That's why I was overjoyed to get a cat. <br />Then another. Then maybe a couple more. <br /> I have no doubt that I'll be a crazy old cat lady later in life.
                    But, that is neither here nor there. Currently, I have three cats. There all unique in their own silly ways.
